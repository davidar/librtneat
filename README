rtNEAT source code distribution version 1.0, 2/24/06
----------------------------------------------------

The rtNEAT software is based on the real-time NeuroEvolution of 
Augmenting Topologies method of evolving artificial neural networks, by 
Stanley and Miikkulainen (2005). The rtNEAT method was originally 
demonstrated in the NERO video game, in which simulated robots learn in 
real time in response to player interaction.  To see rtNEAT demonstrated 
inside NERO, please obtain NERO here:

http://www.nerogame.org/
  
Source code included in this package was originally written by Kenneth 
Stanley (kstanley@cs.ucf.edu) for the Torque Game Engine and later 
translated into generic form by Ryan Cornelius 
(lathentar@mail.utexas.edu).  The public rtNEAT release package was then 
put together by Kenneth Stanley.

Please note that this source code release does not include NERO source 
code because NERO includes proprietary Torque game engine code.  (Torque 
is produced by Garagegame, Inc.) However, the main evolution loop from 
NERO is included in a file by itself that is not intended to be compiled 
into the main package.  It is provided as a reference so that users can 
build similar applications without needing to start from scratch. The 
sample NERO code is in: nero_evolution.cpp

Papers describing the rtNEAT method, NERO, and associated findings are 
available at:

***************************************************************************** 
This software is being released for non-commercial use because rtNEAT, a 
property of the University of Texas at Austin,  is patent-pending at the 
time of release.  If you wish to use rtNEAT for commercial purposes, you 
will need to obtain a license from the University of Texas at Austin.

Much of the code in this package is derived from the original C++ version 
of NEAT, which also came with extensive documentation on programming with 
NEAT.  Therefore, for a detailed tutorial on programming with NEAT, 
please obtain the original C++ distribution at:

http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?neat-c

This distrubution includes both NEAT and rtNEAT.  The core NEAT code has 
itself been updated significantly.  Traits can now be made functional, 
and adaptive networks can be evolved (though the default is 
non-adaptive).  However, the main purpose of this distribution is to 
release rtNEAT source code to the public.

The remainder of this README described what is new in this rtNEAT release 
package.

Included Experiments
-------------------------------------

After running "make" to create the "rtneat" executable, rtNEAT can be run 
from the command line as follows:

% ./rtneat paramfilename.ne

"paramfilename.ne" must be included so that rtNEAT knows what evolution 
parameters you want to use.  You can use one of the supplied parameter 
files (they all end in the .ne extension), or create your own.

The pole2_markov.ne parameter file was designed for markovian pole 
balancing of any type (single pole, double pole, real-time).

The p2nv.ne parameter file was designed for double pole balancing without 
veolicity information.  However, pole2_markov.ne also works with this 
experiment, and with XOR.

When you run rtNEAT from the command line, you are given the option of 5 
experiments:

Please choose an experiment: 
1 - 1-pole balancing
2 - 2-pole balancing, velocity info provided
3 - 2-pole balancing, no velocity info provided (non-markov)
4 - 2-pole balancing, velocity info provided, tested using rtNEAT calls 
and steady-state evolution
5 - XOR
Number:

At the "Number:" prompt, you can enter your choice.  The correct starter 
genome will be loaded in automatically and evolution will commence.  
Most experiments output generational population files ("gen_#") at 
regular intervals based on the "print_every" parameter in the supplied 
.ne file. For example, if print_every is 5, then gen_5, gen_10, gen_15, 
etc., will be written to the directory containing rtNEAT.

Experiment 4 does not output files based on "print_every" because it is 
real-time and therefore does not utilize generations.  Instead, it 
outputs the population into the file "rt_winpop" when a solution is 
found.

-------------------------------------
Testing rtNEAT with Pole Balancing
-------------------------------------

The aim of this source code release is to put rtNEAT into the hands of 
researchers who wish to integrate it into real-time simulations and 
games.  Experiment 4 is included as a validation experiment that shows 
the basic calls to rtNEAT methods, and shows that rtNEAT can perform 
similarly to regular NEAT.  In experiment 4, rtNEAT is used to evolve a 
double pole balancing network that takes pole velocities as inputs.  
Thus experiment 4 is the rtNEAT version of experiment 2, which runs with 
regular generational NEAT.

It is important to note that double pole balancing is not inherently 
"real-time" and therefore does not require rtNEAT to run.  However, the 
point is not that rtNEAT is required, but rather to show that rtNEAT is 
in working order, and to show what the proper function calls are to 
evolve with rtNEAT.  Once you understand how rtNEAT is working with this 
experiment, you will be able to move on to integrating rtNEAT into a true 
real-time simulation with multiple agents evolving simultaneously, 
asynchronously, and interactively, as in NERO.

Instead of generational output, experiment 4 outputs the current species 
each time a new baby is born.  Recall that in rtNEAT, one offspring is 
produced at a time, and one existing individual is chosen to be replaced 
by that offspring.  Thus, output shows the population after each 
individual reproduction:

...
Org 643 fitness: 5 (10 / 9)    [mate]
Species 1 size35 average= 83.5429
Species 2 size15 average= 75.8
Species 3 size15 average= 51.0667
Species 4 size14 average= 39.2857
Species 5 size17 average= 45.0588
Species 6 size16 average= 39.875
Species 11 size2 average= 23.5
Species 12 size2 average= 43.5
Species 15 size3 average= 13.6667
Species 16 size7 average= 52
Species 17 size5 average= 22.4
Species 18 size4 average= 31
Species 19 size9 average= 68.7778
Species 20 size6 average= 28.1667
Pop size: 150
Evaluating new baby: 
Org 644 fitness: 39 (13 / 10)    [mate]
compat_thresh = 3
Species 1 size35 average= 83.5429
Species 2 size15 average= 76.6
Species 3 size15 average= 51.0667
Species 4 size14 average= 39.2857
Species 5 size17 average= 45.0588
Species 6 size19 average= 38.3684
Species 11 size2 average= 23.5
Species 12 size2 average= 43.5
Species 15 size3 average= 13.6667
Species 16 size7 average= 52
Species 17 size5 average= 22.4
Species 18 size1 average= 33
Species 19 size9 average= 68.7778
Species 20 size6 average= 28.1667
Pop size: 150
Evaluating new baby: 
...

The organism # keeps going up until a solution is found.  "Org 644" is 
the 644th organism to be born.  If we divide by 150, we would get the 
number of generatons a population of 150 would have experienced to get to 
the same number of evaluations.  In this case, 644 evaluations is like 
4.29 generations of a population of 150.

Next to each species in the list is its average fitness.  The goal is to 
balance for 100,000 timesteps by a *single* individual.  That is, the 
species average does not need to reach 100,000 because only one member of 
the species must reach that level in order for the experiment to have 
succeeded.

-------------------------------------------------
Integrating rtNEAT into a real Game or Simulation
-------------------------------------------------

To learn to how integrate rtNEAT into a game or simulation, first take a 
look at the pole2_realtime_loop(..) function that is in experiments.cpp.  
That function includes detailed comments on why every call is made and 
how they work.  It includes the main evolution loop that is used in 
experiment 4.

Once you are familiar with that code, you will want to look at 
nero_evolution.cpp.  That file contains the actual core evolution code 
that was used in NERO, with heavy commenting.  While we cannot release 
NERO source code in its entirety, we can release this core evolution code 
because it does not involve Torque system calls.  The code is slightly 
more advanced than the pole2_realtime_loop because it is actually part of 
a true simulator with (usually) 50 agents running around and evolving 
simultaneously.  Accordingly, the main rtNEAT evolution code in the NERO 
file is in a function that is called periodically by a system tick rather 
than in a for loop like in pole2_realtime_loop.  You will notice some 
additional cleanup and debug code in the NERO code sample that may also 
be helpful.

After observing how rtNEAT was called in NERO, you will be in a position 
to write (or even copy!) similar core evolution calls for a process tick 
in your own simulation or game, and should be able to run your own 
real-time evolution experiments.

(Note: The reproduce_one(..) function in species.cpp, which is the main 
rtNEAT reproduction routine, uses truncation selection within a species, 
but can easily be switched to roulette wheel selection by commenting out 
the truncation-selection code and uncommenting the roulette wheel code.  
Both are provided.  NERO used the roulette wheel, although this 
distribution defaults to truncation.)

Conclusion
------------------------------------------------

We hope that this software will be a useful starting point for your own 
explorations in real-time NEAT. The software is provided as is, however, 
we will do our best to maintain it and accommodate suggestions. If you 
want to be notified of future releases of the software or have questions, 
comments, bug reports or suggestions, send email to kstanley@cs.ucf.edu.
